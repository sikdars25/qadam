MYSQL BACKUP - ALTERNATIVE OPTIONS
===================================

ISSUE: mysqldump not in PATH
-----------------------------

The mysqldump command is not available in your PowerShell PATH.
This is normal if MySQL bin folder is not added to system PATH.


OPTION 1: Python Backup Script (EASIEST)
=========================================

Run the Python backup script:

python backup_mysql.py

This will:
✅ Connect to MySQL
✅ Export all tables to JSON
✅ Save as mysql_backup_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.json
✅ Show summary of backed up data

Advantages:
- No need for mysqldump
- Works with Python
- Human-readable JSON format
- Easy to restore if needed


OPTION 2: Skip Backup (SAFE)
=============================

You can skip the backup because:

✅ Migration script does NOT delete MySQL data
✅ Migration only COPIES data to Cosmos DB
✅ Your MySQL database remains untouched
✅ You can always go back to MySQL

If migration fails:
- Your MySQL data is still there
- Nothing is lost
- Just fix the issue and try again


OPTION 3: Use MySQL Workbench
==============================

If you have MySQL Workbench installed:

1. Open MySQL Workbench
2. Connect to your database
3. Server → Data Export
4. Select "qadam_academic" database
5. Choose "Export to Self-Contained File"
6. Click "Start Export"
7. Save as mysql_backup_20251027.sql


OPTION 4: Add mysqldump to PATH
================================

Find MySQL installation folder:
C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 8.0\bin

Add to PATH:
1. Windows Search → "Environment Variables"
2. System Properties → Environment Variables
3. Under "System Variables", find "Path"
4. Click "Edit"
5. Click "New"
6. Add: C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 8.0\bin
7. Click OK
8. Restart PowerShell
9. Try mysqldump again


RECOMMENDED: OPTION 1 or OPTION 2
==================================

OPTION 1 - If you want a backup:
---------------------------------
python backup_mysql.py

Then proceed with migration:
python migrate_mysql_to_cosmos.py


OPTION 2 - Skip backup (safe):
-------------------------------
python migrate_mysql_to_cosmos.py

Migration is safe because:
✅ Only copies data (doesn't delete)
✅ MySQL remains unchanged
✅ Can rollback by using MySQL again
✅ Cosmos DB is separate database


WHAT TO DO NOW:
===============

Choose one:

A. Create backup first:
   python backup_mysql.py
   python migrate_mysql_to_cosmos.py

B. Skip backup and migrate:
   python migrate_mysql_to_cosmos.py

Both are safe! Migration doesn't delete MySQL data.


READY TO PROCEED!
=================

Your next command (choose one):

With backup:
python backup_mysql.py

Without backup (safe):
python migrate_mysql_to_cosmos.py
