# AI Service Consolidation - Oct 31, 2025

## Changes Made

### Files Removed
- ❌ **`ai_service.py` (OLD)** - Deleted (1588 lines)
  - Heavy dependencies: FAISS, SentenceTransformer, ChromaDB
  - Not Azure free-tier compatible
  - Was not being imported anywhere

### Files Renamed
- ✅ **`ai_service_new.py`** → **`ai_service.py`** (354 lines)
  - Lightweight implementation using scikit-learn TF-IDF
  - Azure free-tier compatible
  - Currently in use by the application

### Files Updated
- ✅ **`app.py`**
  - Updated import from `ai_service_new` to `ai_service`
  - Updated comments to reflect the new file name

## Current AI Architecture

### Active Files:
1. **`ai_service.py`** - Main AI service (lightweight)
   - Question paper analysis
   - Solution generation
   - Textbook indexing
   - Semantic search

2. **`ai_helpers.py`** - Helper functions
   - Groq API integration
   - TF-IDF embeddings
   - Text similarity search
   - Question parsing

### Dependencies:
- ✅ scikit-learn (TF-IDF)
- ✅ Groq API (LLM)
- ✅ PyMuPDF (PDF processing)
- ❌ FAISS (removed)
- ❌ SentenceTransformer (removed)
- ❌ ChromaDB (removed)

## Key Improvements

1. **Reduced Complexity**: Single AI service file instead of two
2. **Lighter Dependencies**: Removed heavy ML libraries
3. **Azure Compatible**: Works within free tier limits
4. **Cleaner Codebase**: No duplicate functionality

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Set `GROQ_API_KEY` in Azure Function App settings
2. ✅ Test the consolidated AI service
3. ✅ Verify all endpoints work correctly

## Notes

- The old `ai_service.py` was using FAISS for vector storage, which required binary index files
- The new `ai_service.py` uses in-memory TF-IDF, which is simpler and more portable
- All functionality is preserved, just with lighter dependencies
