RESTART BACKEND TO APPLY FIX
============================

WHAT WAS FIXED:
- MySQL datetime format error
- Frontend was sending: '2025-10-27T12:34:36.992Z'
- MySQL expected: datetime object
- Now converts ISO 8601 to MySQL datetime

ACTION REQUIRED:
================

1. STOP Backend:
   - Press Ctrl+C in terminal running Flask

2. START Backend:
   - Run: python app.py
   - Wait for: "Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000"

3. TEST:
   - Solve a question
   - Should save successfully now!
   - Check console: "âœ… Saved question X to Question Bank"

INSTALLED:
- python-dateutil==2.8.2 (for timestamp parsing)

READY TO TEST!
